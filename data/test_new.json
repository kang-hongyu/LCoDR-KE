This article was prepared following a working meeting of the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis convened to discuss the value of biochemical markers of matrix metabolism in drug development in osteoarthritis. The best candidates are generally molecules or molecular fragments present in cartilage, bone or synovium and may be specific to one type of joint tissue or common to them all. Many currently investigated biomarkers are associated with collagen metabolism in cartilage or bone, or aggrecan metabolism in cartilage. Other biomarkers are related to non-collagenous proteins, inflammation and/or fibrosis. Biomarkers in osteoarthritis can be categorised using the burden of disease, investigative, prognostic, efficacy of intervention, diagnostic and safety classification. There are a number of promising candidates, notably urinary C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type II and serum cartilage oligomeric protein, although none is sufficiently discriminating to differentiate between individual patients and controls (diagnostic) or between patients with different disease severities (burden of disease), predict prognosis in individuals with or without osteoarthritis (prognostic) or perform so consistently that it could function as a surrogate outcome in clinical trials (efficacy of intervention). Future avenues for research include exploration of underlying mechanisms of disease and development of new biomarkers; technological development; the ‘omics’ (genomics, metabolomics, proteomics and lipidomics); design of aggregate scores combining a panel of biomarkers and/or imaging markers into single diagnostic algorithms; and investigation into the relationship between biomarkers and prognosis.</p>", "entities": [{"entity_type": "disease", "name": "Osteoarthritis"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "joint structure"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "cartilage"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "menisci"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "ligaments"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "subchondral bone"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "synovium"}, {"entity_type": "biomarker", "name": "urinary C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type II"}, {"entity_type": "biomarker", "name": "serum cartilage oligomeric protein"}], "relationships": [{"entity_name1": "Osteoarthritis", "relationship": "is_located_in", "entity_name2": "joint structure"}, {"entity_name1": "Osteoarthritis", "relationship": "is_located_in", "entity_name2": "cartilage"}, {"entity_name1": "Osteoarthritis", "relationship": "is_located_in", "entity_name2": "menisci"}, {"entity_name1": "Osteoarthritis", "relationship": "is_located_in", "entity_name2": "ligaments"}, {"entity_name1": "Osteoarthritis", "relationship": "is_located_in", "entity_name2": "subchondral bone"}, {"entity_name1": "Osteoarthritis", "relationship": "is_located_in", "entity_name2": "synovium"}, {"entity_name1": "urinary C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type II", "relationship": "is_biomarker_of", "entity_name2": "Osteoarthritis"}, {"entity_name1": "serum cartilage oligomeric protein", "relationship": "is_biomarker_of", "entity_name2": "Osteoarthritis"}]}

Here, we examined the influence of ANP on β-adrenergic versus Angiotensin II (Ang II)-dependent (G vs. G mediated) modulation of Ca-handling in cardiomyocytes and of hypertrophy in intact hearts. L-type Ca currents and Ca transients in adult isolated murine ventricular myocytes were studied by voltage-clamp recordings and fluorescence microscopy. ANP suppressed Ang II-stimulated Ca currents and transients, but had no effect on isoproterenol stimulation. Ang II suppression by ANP was abolished in cardiomyocytes of mice deficient in GC-A, in cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase I (PKG I) or in the regulator of G protein signalling (RGS) 2, a target of PKG I. Cardiac hypertrophy in response to exogenous Ang II was significantly exacerbated in mice with conditional, cardiomyocyte-restricted GC-A deletion (CM GC-A KO). This was concomitant to increased activation of the Ca/calmodulin-dependent prohypertrophic signal transducer CaMKII. In contrast, β-adrenoreceptor-induced hypertrophy was not enhanced in CM GC-A KO mice. Lastly, while the stimulatory effects of Ang II on Ca-handling were absent in myocytes of mice deficient in TRPC3/TRPC6, the effects of isoproterenol were unchanged. Our data demonstrate a direct myocardial role for ANP/GC-A/cGMP to antagonize the Ca-dependent hypertrophic growth response to Ang II, but not to β-adrenergic stimulation. The selectivity of this interaction is determined by PKG I and RGS2-dependent modulation of Ang II/AT signalling.

PPC reduced infarct size (TTC staining) normalized to area at risk, from 49.0 ± 3.3% in control to 22.9 ± 5.7% in PPC rabbits. In isolated ejecting rabbit hearts, replacing LV pacing by biventricular pacing abolished the protective effect of PPC, whereas ten 30-s periods of high preload provided a protective effect similar to PPC. The protective effect of PPC was neither affected by the adenosine receptor blocker 8-SPT nor by the angiotensin II receptor blocker candesartan, but was abrogated by the cytoskeletal microtubule-disrupting agent colchicine. Blockers of the mitochondrial K channel (5HD), PKC (chelerythrine) and PI3-kinase (wortmannin) all abrogated the protection provided by PPC. In the in situ pig heart, PPC reduced infarct size from 35 ± 4 to 16 ± 12%, a protection which was abolished by the stretch-activated channel blocker gadolinium. No infarct size reduction was achieved if PPC application was delayed by 5 min or if only five pacing cycles were used. The present study indicates that (1) PPC permanently reduces myocardial injury, (2) abnormal mechanical loading is a more likely trigger for PPC than electrical stimulation or G-coupled receptor stimulation and (3) PPC may share downstream pathways with other modes of cardioprotection.</p>", "entities": [{"entity_type": "treatment", "name": "PPC"}, {"entity_type": "treatment", "name": "left ventricular (LV) pacing"}, {"entity_type": "disease", "name": "coronary occlusion"}, {"entity_type": "test", "name": "TTC staining"}, {"entity_type": "treatment", "name": "biventricular pacing"}, {"entity_type": "treatment", "name": "high preload"}, {"entity_type": "drug", "name": "8-SPT"}, {"entity_type": "drug", "name": "candesartan"}, {"entity_type": "drug", "name": "colchicine"}, {"entity_type": "target", "name": "mitochondrial K channel"}, {"entity_type": "target", "name": "PKC"}, {"entity_type": "target", "name": "PI3-kinase"}, {"entity_type": "target", "name": "stretch-activated channel"}, {"entity_type": "disease", "name": "myocardial injury"}, {"entity_type": "drug", "name": "5HD"}, {"entity_type": "drug", "name": "chelerythrine"}, {"entity_type": "drug", "name": "wortmannin"}, {"entity_type": "drug", "name": "gadolinium"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "left ventricular (LV)"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "heart"}, {"entity_type": "target", "name": "adenosine receptor"}, {"entity_type": "target", "name": "angiotensin II receptor"}, {"entity_type": "target", "name": "cytoskeletal microtubule"}], "relationships": [{"entity_name1": "myocardial injury", "relationship": "is_located_in", "entity_name2": "heart"}, {"entity_name1": "TTC staining", "relationship": "is_examination_for", "entity_name2": "myocardial injury"}, {"entity_name1": "mitochondrial K channel", "relationship": "is_target_of", "entity_name2": "5HD"}, {"entity_name1": "PKC", "relationship": "is_target_of", "entity_name2": "chelerythrine"}, {"entity_name1": "PI3-kinase", "relationship": "is_target_of", "entity_name2": "wortmannin"}, {"entity_name1": "stretch-activated channel", "relationship": "is_target_of", "entity_name2": "gadolinium"}, {"entity_name1": "adenosine receptor", "relationship": "is_target_of", "entity_name2": "8-SPT"}, {"entity_name1": "angiotensin II receptor", "relationship": "is_target_of", "entity_name2": "candesartan"}, {"entity_name1": "cytoskeletal microtubule", "relationship": "is_target_of", "entity_name2": "colchicine"}]}

Left ventricular SERCA-mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in TAC by 32% after 6 h, but not different from sham after 24 h. Serum proANP and BNP levels were increased in TAC after 24 h (BNP +274%,  < 0.01; proANP +60%,  < 0.05), but only proANP levels were increased after 6 h (+182%,  < 0.01). cGMP levels were only increased 24 h after TAC (+307%,  < 0.01), but not 6 h after TAC. BNP infusion inhibited the increase in SERCA expression 6 h after TAC. In BNP-receptor-knockout animals (GC-A), the expression of SERCA was still significantly increased 24 h after TAC at the mRNA level by 35% ( < 0.05), as well as at the protein level by 25% ( < 0.05).

In some patients, IHD is ascribed to microvascular dysfunction (MVD): microcirculatory disturbances that reduce myocardial perfusion at the level of myocardial pre-arterioles and arterioles. In a minority of cases, chest pain and reductions in myocardial flow reserve may even occur in patients without any other demonstrable systemic or cardiac disease. In this topical review, we address whether these findings might be caused by impaired myocardial oxygen extraction, caused by capillary flow disturbances further downstream. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) increases approximately linearly with oxygen utilization, but efficient oxygen extraction at high MBF values is known to depend on the parallel reduction of capillary transit time heterogeneity (CTH). Consequently, changes in capillary wall morphology or blood viscosity may impair myocardial oxygen extraction by preventing capillary flow homogenization. Indeed, a recent re-analysis of oxygen transport in tissue shows that elevated CTH can reduce tissue oxygenation by causing a functional shunt of oxygenated blood through the tissue. We review the combined effects of MBF, CTH, and tissue oxygen tension on myocardial oxygen supply. We show that as CTH increases, normal vasodilator responses must be attenuated in order to reduce the degree of functional shunting and improve blood-tissue oxygen concentration gradients to allow sufficient myocardial oxygenation. Theoretically, CTH can reach levels such that increased metabolic demands cannot be met, resulting in tissue hypoxia and angina in the absence of flow-limiting CAD or MVD.

It has significant and diverse clinical implications including reproductive (infertility, hyperandrogenism, hirsutism), metabolic (insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, adverse cardiovascular risk profiles) and psychological features (increased anxiety, depression and worsened quality of life). Polycystic ovary syndrome is a heterogeneous condition and, as such, clinical and research agendas are broad and involve many disciplines. The phenotype varies widely depending on life stage, genotype, ethnicity and environmental factors including lifestyle and bodyweight. Importantly, PCOS has unique interactions with the ever increasing obesity prevalence worldwide as obesity-induced insulin resistance significantly exacerbates all the features of PCOS. Furthermore, it has clinical implications across the lifespan and is relevant to related family members with an increased risk for metabolic conditions reported in first-degree relatives. Therapy should focus on both the short and long-term reproductive, metabolic and psychological features. Given the aetiological role of insulin resistance and the impact of obesity on both hyperinsulinaemia and hyperandrogenism, multidisciplinary lifestyle improvement aimed at normalising insulin resistance, improving androgen status and aiding weight management is recognised as a crucial initial treatment strategy. Modest weight loss of 5% to 10% of initial body weight has been demonstrated to improve many of the features of PCOS. Management should focus on support, education, addressing psychological factors and strongly emphasising healthy lifestyle with targeted medical therapy as required. Monitoring and management of long-term metabolic complications is also an important part of routine clinical care.

The results in human studies were unpredictable and raised controversy. Some patients showed remarkable improvement, but many of the patients who underwent transplantation experienced serious disabling adverse reactions, putting an end to human trials since the late 1990 s. These side effects consisted of patients' developing troublesome involuntary, uncontrolled movements in the absence of dopaminergic medication, so-called off-phase, graft-induced dyskinesias. Notwithstanding the several mechanisms having been proposed, the pathogenesis of this type of dyskinesias remained unclear and there was no effective treatment. It has been suggested that graft-induced dyskinesias could be related to fiber outgrowth from the graft causing increased dopamine release, that could be related to the failure of grafts to restore a precise distribution of dopaminergic synaptic contacts on host neurons or may also be induced by inflammatory and immune responses around the graft. A recent study, however, hypothesized that an important factor for the development of graft-induced dyskinesias could include the composition of the cell suspension and specifically that a high proportion of serotonergic neurons cografted in these transplants engage in nonphysiological properties such as false transmitter release. The findings from this study showed serotonergic hyperinnervation in the grafted striatum of two patients with Parkinson's disease who exhibited major motor recovery after transplantation with fetal mesencephalic tissue but later developed graft-induced dyskinesias. Moreover, the dyskinesias were significantly attenuated by administration of a serotonin agonist, which activates the inhibitory serotonin autoreceptors and attenuates transmitter release from serotonergic neurons, indicating that graft-induced dyskinesias were caused by the dense serotonergic innervation engaging in false transmitter release.

There are considerable phenomenological similarities between sickness behavior and depression, for example, behavioral inhibition, anorexia and weight loss, and melancholic (anhedonia), physio-somatic (fatigue, hyperalgesia, malaise), anxiety and neurocognitive symptoms. In clinical depression, however, a transition occurs to sensitization of immuno-inflammatory pathways, progressive damage by oxidative and nitrosative stress to lipids, proteins, and DNA, and autoimmune responses directed against self-epitopes. The latter mechanisms are the substrate of a neuroprogressive process, whereby multiple depressive episodes cause neural tissue damage and consequent functional and cognitive sequelae.

{"id": "L0100274879", "content": "<p>Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation encompasses a heterogeneous group of rare neurodegenerative disorders that are characterized by iron accumulation in the brain. Severe generalized dystonia is frequently a prominent symptom and can be very disabling, causing gait impairment, difficulty with speech and swallowing, pain and respiratory distress. Several case reports and one case series have been published concerning therapeutic outcome of pallidal deep brain stimulation in dystonia caused by neurodegeneration with brain iron degeneration, reporting mostly favourable outcomes. However, with case studies, there may be a reporting bias towards favourable outcome. Thus, we undertook this multi-centre retrospective study to gather worldwide experiences with bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation in patients with neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation. A total of 16 centres contributed 23 patients with confirmed neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation and bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation. Patient details including gender, age at onset, age at operation, genetic status, magnetic resonance imaging status, history and clinical findings were requested. Data on severity of dystonia (Burke Fahn Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale—Motor Scale, Barry Albright Dystonia Scale), disability (Burke Fahn Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale—Disability Scale), quality of life (subjective global rating from 1 to 10 obtained retrospectively from patient and caregiver) as well as data on supportive therapy, concurrent pharmacotherapy, stimulation settings, adverse events and side effects were collected. Data were collected once preoperatively and at 2–6 and 9–15 months postoperatively. The primary outcome measure was change in severity of dystonia. The mean improvement in severity of dystonia was 28.5% at 2–6 months and 25.7% at 9–15 months. At 9–15 months postoperatively, 66.7% of patients showed an improvement of 20% or more in severity of dystonia, and 31.3% showed an improvement of 20% or more in disability. Global quality of life ratings showed a median improvement of 83.3% at 9–15 months. Severity of dystonia preoperatively and disease duration predicted improvement in severity of dystonia at 2–6 months; this failed to reach significance at 9–15 months. The study confirms that dystonia in neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation improves with bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation, although this improvement is not as great as the benefit reported in patients with primary generalized dystonias or some other secondary dystonias. The patients with more severe dystonia seem to benefit more. A well-controlled, multi-centre prospective study is necessary to enable evidence-based therapeutic decisions and better predict therapeutic outcomes.</p>", "entities": [{"entity_type": "disease", "name": "Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation"}, {"entity_type": "symptom", "name": "Severe generalized dystonia"}, {"entity_type": "symptom", "name": "gait impairment"}, {"entity_type": "symptom", "name": "difficulty with speech and swallowing"}, {"entity_type": "symptom", "name": "pain"}, {"entity_type": "symptom", "name": "respiratory distress"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "brain"}, {"entity_type": "treatment", "name": "pallidal deep brain stimulation"}, {"entity_type": "test", "name": "magnetic resonance imaging"}, {"entity_type": "test", "name": "Burke Fahn Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale—Motor Scale"}, {"entity_type": "test", "name": "Barry Albright Dystonia Scale"}, {"entity_type": "test", "name": "Burke Fahn Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale—Disability Scale"}], "relationships": [{"entity_name1": "Severe generalized dystonia", "relationship": "is_symptom_of", "entity_name2": "Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation"}, {"entity_name1": "gait impairment", "relationship": "is_symptom_of", "entity_name2": "Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation"}, {"entity_name1": "difficulty with speech and swallowing", "relationship": "is_symptom_of", "entity_name2": "Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation"}, {"entity_name1": "pain", "relationship": "is_symptom_of", "entity_name2": "Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation"}, {"entity_name1": "respiratory distress", "relationship": "is_symptom_of", "entity_name2": "Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation"}, {"entity_name1": "Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation", "relationship": "is_located_in", "entity_name2": "brain"}, {"entity_name1": "magnetic resonance imaging", "relationship": "is_examination_for", "entity_name2": "Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation"}, {"entity_name1": "Burke Fahn Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale—Motor Scale", "relationship": "is_examination_for", "entity_name2": "Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation"}, {"entity_name1": "Barry Albright Dystonia Scale", "relationship": "is_examination_for", "entity_name2": "Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation"}, {"entity_name1": "Burke Fahn Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale—Disability Scale", "relationship": "is_examination_for", "entity_name2": "Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation"}]}

In the present study we investigated the capacity of oestrogen receptor β ligand treatment to affect callosal axon demyelination and stimulate endogenous myelination in chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis using electrophysiology, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry and tract-tracing methods. Oestrogen receptor β ligand treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice prevented both histopathological and functional abnormalities of callosal axons despite the presence of inflammation. Specifically, there were fewer demyelinated, damaged axons and more myelinated axons with intact nodes of Ranvier in oestrogen receptor β ligand-treated mice. In addition, oestrogen receptor β ligand treatment caused an increase in mature oligodendrocyte numbers, a significant increase in myelin sheath thickness and axon transport. Functional analysis of callosal axon conduction showed a significant improvement in compound action potential amplitudes, latency and in axon refractoriness.

Structural changes have been found in frontal cortex and striatum in children and adolescents. A limited number of morphometric studies in Tourette syndrome persisting into adulthood suggest ongoing structural alterations affecting frontostriatal circuits. Using cortical thickness estimation and voxel-based analysis of T1- and diffusion-weighted structural magnetic resonance images, we examined 40 adults with Tourette syndrome in comparison with 40 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Patients with Tourette syndrome showed relative grey matter volume reduction in orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices bilaterally. Cortical thinning extended into the limbic mesial temporal lobe. The grey matter changes were modulated additionally by the presence of co-morbidities and symptom severity. Prefrontal cortical thickness reduction correlated negatively with tic severity, while volume increase in primary somatosensory cortex depended on the intensity of premonitory sensations. Orbitofrontal cortex volume changes were further associated with abnormal water diffusivity within grey matter. White matter analysis revealed changes in fibre coherence in patients with Tourette syndrome within anterior parts of the corpus callosum. The severity of motor tics and premonitory urges had an impact on the integrity of tracts corresponding to cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical connections. Our results provide empirical support for a patho-aetiological model of Tourette syndrome based on developmental abnormalities, with perturbation of compensatory systems marking persistence of symptoms into adulthood. We interpret the symptom severity related grey matter volume increase in distinct functional brain areas as evidence of ongoing structural plasticity. The convergence of evidence from volume and water diffusivity imaging strengthens the validity of our findings and attests to the value of a novel multimodal combination of volume and cortical thickness estimations that provides unique and complementary information by exploiting their differential sensitivity to structural change.</p>", "entities": [{"entity_type": "disease", "name": "Tourette syndrome"}, {"entity_type": "complication", "name": "attention deficit hyperactivity disorder"}, {"entity_type": "complication", "name": "obsessive-compulsive disorder"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "frontal cortex"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "striatum"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "orbitofrontal cortices"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "anterior cingulate cortices"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "ventrolateral prefrontal cortices"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "limbic mesial temporal lobe"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "primary somatosensory cortex"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "anterior parts of the corpus callosum"}, {"entity_type": "test", "name": "cortical thickness estimation"}, {"entity_type": "test", "name": "voxel-based analysis"}, {"entity_type": "test", "name": "T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance images"}, {"entity_type": "test", "name": "diffusion-weighted structural magnetic resonance images"}, {"entity_type": "symptom", "name": "motor tics"}, {"entity_type": "symptom", "name": "premonitory urges"}], "relationships": [{"entity_name1": "attention deficit hyperactivity disorder", "relationship": "complication_of", "entity_name2": "Tourette syndrome"}, {"entity_name1": "obsessive-compulsive disorder", "relationship": "complication_of", "entity_name2": "Tourette syndrome"}, {"entity_name1": "Tourette syndrome", "relationship": "is_located_in", "entity_name2": "frontal cortex"}, {"entity_name1": "Tourette syndrome", "relationship": "is_located_in", "entity_name2": "striatum"}, {"entity_name1": "Tourette syndrome", "relationship": "is_located_in", "entity_name2": "orbitofrontal cortices"}, {"entity_name1": "Tourette syndrome", "relationship": "is_located_in", "entity_name2": "anterior cingulate cortices"}, {"entity_name1": "Tourette syndrome", "relationship": "is_located_in", "entity_name2": "ventrolateral prefrontal cortices"}, {"entity_name1": "Tourette syndrome", "relationship": "is_located_in", "entity_name2": "limbic mesial temporal lobe"}, {"entity_name1": "Tourette syndrome", "relationship": "is_located_in", "entity_name2": "primary somatosensory cortex"}, {"entity_name1": "Tourette syndrome", "relationship": "is_located_in", "entity_name2": "anterior parts of the corpus callosum"}, {"entity_name1": "motor tics", "relationship": "is_symptom_of", "entity_name2": "Tourette syndrome"}, {"entity_name1": "premonitory urges", "relationship": "is_symptom_of", "entity_name2": "Tourette syndrome"}, {"entity_name1": "cortical thickness estimation", "relationship": "is_examination_for", "entity_name2": "Tourette syndrome"}, {"entity_name1": "voxel-based analysis", "relationship": "is_examination_for", "entity_name2": "Tourette syndrome"}, {"entity_name1": "T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance images", "relationship": "is_examination_for", "entity_name2": "Tourette syndrome"}, {"entity_name1": "diffusion-weighted structural magnetic resonance images", "relationship": "is_examination_for", "entity_name2": "Tourette syndrome"}]}

Enterokinase is membrane bound and cleaves the neurofilament heavy chain at positions 476 and 986. Using a 100 kDa microdialysis cut-off membrane the two proteolytic breakdown products, extracellular fluid neurofilament heavy chains NfH and NfH, can be quantified with a relative recovery of 20%.

Following high-velocity impact traumatic brain injury, microdialysate extracellular fluid neurofilament heavy chain levels were significantly higher (6.18 ± 2.94 ng/ml) and detectable for longer (>4 days) compared with traumatic brain injury secondary to falls (0.84 ± 1.77 ng/ml, <2 days). During the initial 16 h following traumatic brain injury, strong correlations were found between extracellular fluid neurofilament heavy chain levels and physiological parameters (systemic blood pressure, anaerobic cerebral metabolism, excessive brain tissue oxygenation, elevated brain temperature). Finally, extracellular fluid neurofilament heavy chain levels were of prognostic value, predicting mortality with an odds ratio of 7.68 (confidence interval 2.15–27.46,  = 0.001).

Noting that children with narcolepsy often display complex abnormal motor behaviours close to disease onset that do not meet the classical definition of cataplexy, we systematically analysed motor features in 39 children with narcolepsy with cataplexy in comparison with 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls.

These observations suggest that paediatric narcolepsy with cataplexy often co-occurs with a complex movement disorder at disease onset, a phenomenon that may vanish later in the course of the disease.

Although various phenotypic and research diagnostic classification systems exist and several prognostic models have been generated, there is no staging system. Staging criteria for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis would help to provide a universal and objective measure of disease progression with benefits for patient care, resource allocation, research classifications and clinical trial design. We therefore sought to define easily identified clinical milestones that could be shown to occur at specific points in the disease course, reflect disease progression and impact prognosis and treatment. A tertiary referral centre clinical database was analysed, consisting of 1471 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis seen between 1993 and 2007. Milestones were defined as symptom onset (functional involvement by weakness, wasting, spasticity, dysarthria or dysphagia of one central nervous system region defined as bulbar, upper limb, lower limb or diaphragmatic), diagnosis, functional involvement of a second region, functional involvement of a third region, needing gastrostomy and non-invasive ventilation. Milestone timings were standardized as proportions of time elapsed through the disease course using information from patients who had died by dividing time to a milestone by disease duration. Milestones occurred at predictable proportions of the disease course. Diagnosis occurred at 35% through the disease course, involvement of a second region at 38%, a third region at 61%, need for gastrostomy at 77% and need for non-invasive ventilation at 80%. We therefore propose a simple staging system for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Stage 1: symptom onset (involvement of first region); Stage 2A: diagnosis; Stage 2B: involvement of second region; Stage 3: involvement of third region; Stage 4A: need for gastrostomy; and Stage 4B: need for non-invasive ventilation. Validation of this staging system will require further studies in other populations, in population registers and in other clinic databases.

Here we relate the clinical progression, amyloid and functional brain positron emission tomography imaging with molecular neuropathological alterations at autopsy to gain new insight into the relationship between β-amyloid accumulation, inflammatory processes and the cholinergic neurotransmitter system in Alzheimer’s disease brain. The patient underwent positron emission tomography studies with F-fluorodeoxyglucose three times (at ages 53, 56 and 58 years) and twice with Pittsburgh Compound B (at ages 56 and 58 years), prior to death at 61 years of age. The patient showed a pronounced decline in cerebral glucose metabolism and cognition during disease progression, while Pittsburgh Compound B retention remained high and stable at follow-up. Neuropathological examination of the brain at autopsy confirmed the clinical diagnosis of pure Alzheimer’s disease. A comprehensive neuropathological investigation was performed in nine brain regions to measure the regional distribution of β-amyloid, neurofibrillary tangles and the levels of binding of H-nicotine and I-α-bungarotoxin to neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes, H-L-deprenyl to activated astrocytes and H-PK11195 to microglia, as well as butyrylcholinesterase activity. Regional C-Pittsburgh Compound B-positron emission tomography retention positively correlated with H-Pittsburgh Compound B binding, total insoluble β-amyloid, and β-amyloid plaque distribution, but not with the number of neurofibrillary tangles measured at autopsy.

Greater duration of cocaine dependence was correlated with greater grey matter volume reduction in orbitofrontal, cingulate and insular cortex. Greater impairment of attentional control was associated with reduced volume in insular cortex and increased volume of caudate nucleus. Greater compulsivity of drug use was associated with reduced volume in orbitofrontal cortex.

{"id": "L0100274972", "content": "<p>Patients with Parkinson's disease suffer from significant motor impairments and accompanying cognitive and affective dysfunction due to progressive disturbances of basal ganglia–cortical gating loops. Parkinson's disease has a long presymptomatic stage, which indicates a substantial capacity of the human brain to compensate for dopaminergic nerve degeneration before clinical manifestation of the disease. Neuroimaging studies provide evidence that increased motor-related cortical activity can compensate for progressive dopaminergic nerve degeneration in carriers of a single mutant or gene, who show a mild but significant reduction of dopamine metabolism in the basal ganglia in the complete absence of clinical motor signs. However, it is currently unknown whether similar compensatory mechanisms are effective in non-motor basal ganglia–cortical gating loops. Here, we ask whether asymptomatic mutation carriers show altered patterns of brain activity during processing of facial gestures, and whether this might compensate for latent facial emotion recognition deficits. Current theories in social neuroscience assume that execution and perception of facial gestures are linked by a special class of visuomotor neurons (‘mirror neurons’) in the ventrolateral premotor cortex/pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann area 44/6). We hypothesized that asymptomatic mutation carriers would show increased activity in this area during processing of affective facial gestures, replicating the compensatory motor effects that have previously been observed in these individuals. Additionally, mutation carriers might show altered activity in other basal ganglia–cortical gating loops. Eight asymptomatic heterozygous mutation carriers and eight matched controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging and a subsequent facial emotion recognition task. As predicted, mutation carriers showed significantly stronger activity in the right ventrolateral premotor cortex during execution and perception of affective facial gestures than healthy controls. Furthermore, mutation carriers showed a slightly reduced ability to recognize facial emotions that was least severe in individuals who showed the strongest increase of ventrolateral premotor activity. In addition, mutation carriers showed a significantly weaker than normal increase of activity in the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex (inferior frontal gyrus pars orbitalis, Brodmann area 47), which was unrelated to facial emotion recognition ability. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that compensatory activity in the ventrolateral premotor cortex during processing of affective facial gestures can reduce impairments in facial emotion recognition in subclinical mutation carriers. A breakdown of this compensatory mechanism might lead to the impairment of facial expressivity and facial emotion recognition observed in manifest Parkinson's disease.</p>", "entities": [{"entity_type": "disease", "name": "Parkinson's disease"}, {"entity_type": "symptom", "name": "motor impairments"}, {"entity_type": "symptom", "name": "cognitive and affective dysfunction"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "basal ganglia–cortical gating loops"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "ventrolateral premotor cortex"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "inferior frontal gyrus"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "Brodmann area 44/6"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "mirror neurons"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "lateral orbitofrontal cortex"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "Brodmann area 47"}, {"entity_type": "complication", "name": "facial emotion recognition deficits"}, {"entity_type": "complication", "name": "facial expressivity impairment"}, {"entity_type": "test", "name": "functional magnetic resonance imaging"}, {"entity_type": "test", "name": "facial emotion recognition task"}, {"entity_type": "biomarker", "name": "dopamine metabolism"}, {"entity_type": "biomarker", "name": "motor-related cortical activity"}], "relationships": [{"entity_name1": "motor impairments", "relationship": "is_symptom_of", "entity_name2": "Parkinson's disease"}, {"entity_name1": "cognitive and affective dysfunction", "relationship": "is_symptom_of", "entity_name2": "Parkinson's disease"}, {"entity_name1": "facial emotion recognition deficits", "relationship": "complication_of", "entity_name2": "Parkinson's disease"}, {"entity_name1": "facial expressivity impairment", "relationship": "complication_of", "entity_name2": "Parkinson's disease"}, {"entity_name1": "Parkinson's disease", "relationship": "is_located_in", "entity_name2": "basal ganglia–cortical gating loops"}, {"entity_name1": "dopamine metabolism", "relationship": "is_biomarker_of", "entity_name2": "Parkinson's disease"}, {"entity_name1": "motor-related cortical activity", "relationship": "is_biomarker_of", "entity_name2": "Parkinson's disease"}, {"entity_name1": "functional magnetic resonance imaging", "relationship": "is_examination_for", "entity_name2": "Parkinson's disease"}, {"entity_name1": "facial emotion recognition task", "relationship": "is_examination_for", "entity_name2": "Parkinson's disease"}]}

No study has systematically examined, through modern psychometric approach, whether physicians are able to properly use the Medical Research Council grades. The objectives of this study were: (i) to investigate physicians’ ability to discriminate among the Medical Research Council categories in patients with different neuromuscular disorders and with various degrees of weakness through thresholds examination using Rasch analysis as a modern psychometric method; (ii) to examine possible factors influencing physicians’ ability to apply the Medical Research Council categories through differential item function analyses; and (iii) to examine whether the widely used Medical Research Council 12 muscles sum score in patients with Guillain–Barré syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy would meet Rasch model's expectations. A total of 1065 patients were included from nine cohorts with the following diseases: Guillain–Barré syndrome ( = 480); myotonic dystrophy type-1 ( = 169); chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy ( = 139); limb-girdle muscular dystrophy ( = 105); multifocal motor neuropathy ( = 102); Pompe's disease ( = 62) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined related polyneuropathy ( = 8). Medical Research Council data of 72 muscles were collected. Rasch analyses were performed on Medical Research Council data for each cohort separately and after pooling data at the muscle level to increase category frequencies, and on the Medical Research Council sum score in patients with Guillain–Barré syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. Disordered thresholds were demonstrated in 74–79% of the muscles examined, indicating physicians’ inability to discriminate between most Medical Research Council categories. Factors such as physicians’ experience or illness type did not influence these findings. Thresholds were restored after rescoring the Medical Research Council grades from six to four options (0, paralysis; 1, severe weakness; 2, slight weakness; 3, normal strength). The Medical Research Council sum score acceptably fulfilled Rasch model expectations after rescoring the response options and creating subsets to resolve local dependency and item bias on diagnosis. In conclusion, a modified, Rasch-built four response category Medical Research Council grading system is proposed, resolving clinicians’ inability to differentiate among its original response categories and improving clinical applicability.

{"id": "L0100274983", "content": "<p>Damage to the corticospinal tract is a leading cause of motor disability, for example in stroke or spinal cord injury. Some function usually recovers, but whether plasticity of undamaged ipsilaterally descending corticospinal axons and/or brainstem pathways such as the reticulospinal tract contributes to recovery is unknown. Here, we examined the connectivity in these pathways to motor neurons after recovery from corticospinal lesions. Extensive unilateral lesions of the medullary corticospinal fibres in the pyramidal tract were made in three adult macaque monkeys. After an initial contralateral flaccid paralysis, motor function rapidly recovered, after which all animals were capable of climbing and supporting their weight by gripping the cage bars with the contralesional hand. In one animal where experimental testing was carried out, there was (as expected) no recovery of fine independent finger movements. Around 6 months post-lesion, intracellular recordings were made from 167 motor neurons innervating hand and forearm muscles. Synaptic responses evoked by stimulating the unlesioned ipsilateral pyramidal tract and the medial longitudinal fasciculus were recorded and compared with control responses in 207 motor neurons from six unlesioned animals. Input from the ipsilateral pyramidal tract was rare and weak in both lesioned and control animals, suggesting a limited role for this pathway in functional recovery. In contrast, mono- and disynaptic excitatory post-synaptic potentials elicited from the medial longitudinal fasciculus significantly increased in average size after recovery, but only in motor neurons innervating forearm flexor and intrinsic hand muscles, not in forearm extensor motor neurons. We conclude that reticulospinal systems sub-serve some of the functional recovery after corticospinal lesions. The imbalanced strengthening of connections to flexor, but not extensor, motor neurons mirrors the extensor weakness and flexor spasm which in neurological experience is a common limitation to recovery in stroke survivors.</p>", "entities": [{"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "corticospinal tract"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "pyramidal tract"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "reticulospinal tract"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "medial longitudinal fasciculus"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "motor neurons"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "hand muscles"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "forearm muscles"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "medullary corticospinal fibres"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "ipsilateral pyramidal tract"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "brainstem pathways"}, {"entity_type": "disease", "name": "stroke"}, {"entity_type": "disease", "name": "spinal cord injury"}, {"entity_type": "complication", "name": "motor disability"}, {"entity_type": "complication", "name": "extensor weakness"}, {"entity_type": "complication", "name": "flexor spasm"}, {"entity_type": "symptom", "name": "flaccid paralysis"}, {"entity_type": "test", "name": "intracellular recordings"}], "relationships": [{"entity_name1": "motor disability", "relationship": "complication_of", "entity_name2": "stroke"}, {"entity_name1": "motor disability", "relationship": "complication_of", "entity_name2": "spinal cord injury"}, {"entity_name1": "extensor weakness", "relationship": "complication_of", "entity_name2": "stroke"}, {"entity_name1": "flexor spasm", "relationship": "complication_of", "entity_name2": "stroke"}, {"entity_name1": "flaccid paralysis", "relationship": "is_symptom_of", "entity_name2": "stroke"}, {"entity_name1": "flaccid paralysis", "relationship": "is_symptom_of", "entity_name2": "spinal cord injury"}, {"entity_name1": "intracellular recordings", "relationship": "is_examination_for", "entity_name2": "stroke"}, {"entity_name1": "intracellular recordings", "relationship": "is_examination_for", "entity_name2": "spinal cord injury"}]}

The purpose of this review is to integrate these clinical and pathophysiological features of tremor in Parkinson's disease. We first describe clinical and pathological differences between tremor-dominant and non-tremor Parkinson's disease subtypes, and then summarize recent studies on the pathophysiology of tremor. We also discuss a newly proposed ‘dimmer-switch model’ that explains tremor as resulting from the combined actions of two circuits: the basal ganglia that trigger tremor episodes and the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit that produces the tremor. Finally, we address several important open questions: why resting tremor stops during voluntary movements, why it has a variable response to dopaminergic treatment, why it indicates a benign Parkinson's disease subtype and why its expression decreases with disease progression.</p>", "entities": [{"entity_type": "symptom", "name": "Tremor"}, {"entity_type": "disease", "name": "Parkinson's disease"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "basal ganglia"}, {"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit"}, {"entity_type": "symptom", "name": "resting tremor"}, {"entity_type": "treatment", "name": "dopaminergic treatment"}], "relationships": [{"entity_name1": "Tremor", "relationship": "is_symptom_of", "entity_name2": "Parkinson's disease"}, {"entity_name1": "resting tremor", "relationship": "is_symptom_of", "entity_name2": "Parkinson's disease"}, {"entity_name1": "Parkinson's disease", "relationship": "is_located_in", "entity_name2": "basal ganglia"}, {"entity_name1": "Parkinson's disease", "relationship": "is_located_in", "entity_name2": "cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit"}]}

How and why false recognition occurs in such patients is currently unknown, and treatments targeting this specific mnemonic abnormality have not been attempted. Here, we used a modified object recognition paradigm to show that the tgCRND8 mouse—which overexpresses amyloid β and develops amyloid plaques similar to those in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease—exhibits false recognition. Furthermore, we found that false recognition did not occur when tgCRND8 mice were kept in a dark, quiet chamber during the delay, paralleling previous findings in patients with mild cognitive impairment, which is often considered to be prodromal Alzheimer’s disease. Additionally, false recognition did not occur when mice were treated with the partial -methyl--aspartic acid receptor antagonist memantine. In a subsequent experiment, we found abnormally enhanced -methyl--aspartic acid receptor-dependent long-term depression in these mice, which could be normalized by treatment with memantine. We suggest that Alzheimer’s disease typical amyloid β pathology leads to aberrant synaptic plasticity, thereby making memory representations more susceptible to interfering sensory input, thus increasing the likelihood of false recognition.

However, previous studies highlight vascular abnormalities in patients harbouring mitochondrial DNA defects, particularly in those with the m.3243A>G mutation in whom stroke-like events are part of the mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes syndrome. We investigated microangiopathic changes in the cerebellum of 16 genetically and clinically well-defined patients. Respiratory chain deficiency, high levels of mutated mitochondrial DNA and increased mitochondrial mass were present within the smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells comprising the vessel wall in patients. These changes were not limited to those harbouring the m.3243A>G mutation frequently associated with mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes, but were documented in patients harbouring m.8344A>G and autosomal recessive () mutations. In 8 of the 16 patients, multiple ischaemic-like lesions occurred in the cerebellar cortex suggestive of vascular smooth muscle cell dysfunction. Indeed, changes in vascular smooth muscle and endothelium distribution and cell size are indicative of vascular cell loss. We found evidence of blood–brain barrier breakdown characterized by plasma protein extravasation following fibrinogen and IgG immunohistochemistry.

To date, >150 different pathogenic mutations have been described in . Some mutations behave as both dominant and recessive alleles, but an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern is much more common. The most frequently detected pathogenic mutation in the Caucasian population is c.1399G>A leading to a p.Ala467Thr missense mutation in the linker domain of the protein. Although many patients are homozygous for this mutation, clinical presentation is highly variable, ranging from childhood-onset Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome to adult-onset sensory ataxic neuropathy dysarthria and ophthalmoparesis. The reasons for this are not clear, but familial clustering of phenotypes suggests that modifying factors may influence the clinical manifestation. In this study, we collected clinical, histological and biochemical data from 68 patients carrying the homozygous p.Ala467Thr mutation from eight diagnostic centres in Europe and the USA. We performed DNA analysis in 44 of these patients to search for a genetic modifier within and flanking regions potentially involved in the regulation of gene expression, and extended our analysis to other genes affecting mitochondrial DNA maintenance (). The clinical presentation included almost the entire phenotypic spectrum of all known mutations. Interestingly, the clinical presentation was similar in siblings, implying a genetic basis for the phenotypic variability amongst homozygotes. However, the p.Ala467Thr allele was present on a shared haplotype in each affected individual, and there was no correlation between the clinical presentation and genetic variants in any of the analysed nuclear genes. Patients with mitochondrial DNA haplogroup U developed epilepsy significantly less frequently than patients with any other mitochondrial DNA haplotype. Epilepsy was reported significantly more frequently in females than in males, and also showed an association with one of the chromosomal markers defining the haplotype. In conclusion, our clinical results show that the homozygous p.Ala467Thr mutation does not cause discrete phenotypes, as previously suggested, but rather there is a continuum of clinical symptoms. Our results suggest that the mitochondrial DNA background plays an important role in modifying the disease phenotype but nuclear modifiers, epigenetic and environmental factors may also influence the severity of disease.</p>", "entities": [{"entity_type": "gene", "name": "Polymerase-γ"}, {"entity_type": "disease", "name": "mitochondrial diseases"}, {"entity_type": "disease", "name": "Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome"}, {"entity_type": "disease", "name": "adult-onset sensory ataxic neuropathy dysarthria and ophthalmoparesis"}, {"entity_type": "gene", "name": "p.Ala467Thr"}, {"entity_type": "test", "name": "DNA analysis"}, {"entity_type": "biomarker", "name": "mitochondrial DNA haplogroup U"}, {"entity_type": "complication", "name": "Epilepsy"}], "relationships": [{"entity_name1": "Epilepsy", "relationship": "complication_of", "entity_name2": "mitochondrial diseases"}, {"entity_name1": "DNA analysis", "relationship": "is_examination_for", "entity_name2": "mitochondrial diseases"}, {"entity_name1": "mitochondrial DNA haplogroup U", "relationship": "is_biomarker_of", "entity_name2": "mitochondrial diseases"}]}

Dogs with severe chronic thoracolumbar spinal cord injuries (equivalent to ASIA grade ‘A’ human patients at ∼12 months after injury) were entered into a randomized double-blinded clinical trial in which they were allocated to receive either intraspinal autologous cells derived from olfactory mucosal cultures or injection of cell transport medium alone. Recipients of olfactory mucosal cell transplants gained significantly better fore–hind coordination than those dogs receiving cell transport medium alone. There were no significant differences in outcome between treatment groups in measures of long tract functionality.

However, in the last decade several investigations have reported that patients with medial temporal lobe damage exhibit an abnormally large number of errors when required to remember visual information over brief intervals. But the nature of the deficit and the type of error associated with medial temporal lobe lesions remains to be fully established. Voltage-gated potassium channel complex antibody-associated limbic encephalitis has recently been recognized as a form of treatable autoimmune encephalitis, frequently associated with imaging changes in the medial temporal lobe. Here, we tested a group of these patients using two newly developed visual short-term memory tasks with a sensitive, continuous measure of report. These tests enabled us to study the nature of reporting errors, rather than only their frequency. On both paradigms, voltage-gated potassium channel complex antibody patients exhibited larger errors specifically when several items had to be remembered, but not for a single item. Crucially, their errors were strongly associated with an increased tendency to report the property of the wrong item stored in memory, rather than simple degradation of memory precision. Thus, memory for isolated aspects of items was normal, but patients were impaired at binding together the different properties belonging to an item, e.g. spatial location and object identity, or colour and orientation. This occurred regardless of whether objects were shown simultaneously or sequentially. Binding errors support the view that the medial temporal lobe is involved in linking together different types of information, potentially represented in different parts of the brain, regardless of memory duration.

It has been proposed that cancer stem-like cells display increased drug resistance, through the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporters that detoxify cells by effluxing exogenous compounds. Here, we investigated the ‘side population’ phenotype based on efflux properties of ATP-binding cassette transporters in freshly isolated human glioblastoma samples and intracranial xenografts derived thereof. Using fluorescence hybridization analysis on sorted cells obtained from glioblastoma biopsies, as well as human tumour xenografts developed in immunodeficient enhanced green fluorescence protein-expressing mice that allow an unequivocal tumour-stroma discrimination, we show that side population cells in human glioblastoma are non-neoplastic and exclusively stroma-derived. Tumour cells were consistently devoid of efflux properties regardless of their genetic background, tumour ploidy or stem cell associated marker expression. Using multi-parameter flow cytometry we identified the stromal side population in human glioblastoma to be brain-derived endothelial cells with a minor contribution of astrocytes. In contrast with their foetal counterpart, neural stem/progenitor cells in the adult brain did not display the side population phenotype. Of note, we show that CD133-positive cells often associated with cancer stem-like cells in glioblastoma biopsies, do not represent a homogenous cell population and include CD31-positive endothelial cells. Interestingly, treatment of brain tumours with the anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab reduced total vessel density, but did not affect the efflux properties of endothelial cells. In conclusion our findings contribute to an unbiased identification of cancer stem-like cells and stromal cells in brain neoplasms, and provide novel insight into the complex issue of drug delivery to the brain.

This individual was heterozygous (MV) at codon 129 of the prion protein gene (), whereas all previous definite and probable cases of variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease have been methionine homozygotes (MM).

Additionally it is important to establish whether the codon 129 genotype has influenced the transmission characteristics of the infectious agent. Brain and spleen from the MV blood recipient were inoculated into murine strains that have consistently demonstrated transmission of the variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease agent.

Longer incubation times were observed for the blood donor spleen inoculum compared with the blood donor brain inoculum, suggesting lower titres of infectivity in the spleen. The distribution of vacuolar pathology and abnormal prion protein in infected mice were similar following inoculation with both donor and recipient spleen homogenates, providing initial evidence of similar transmission properties after propagation in codon 129 MV and MM individuals.

Folic acid is thought to act through folate one-carbon metabolism, which transfers one-carbon units for methylation reactions and nucleotide biosynthesis. Hence suboptimal performance of the intervening reactions could limit the efficacy of folic acid. We hypothesized that direct supplementation with nucleotides, downstream of folate metabolism, has the potential to support neural tube closure. Therefore, in a mouse model that exhibits folic acid-resistant neural tube defects, we tested the effect of specific combinations of pyrimidine and purine nucleotide precursors and observed a significant protective effect. Labelling in whole embryo culture showed that nucleotides are taken up by the neurulating embryo and incorporated into genomic DNA. Furthermore, the mitotic index was elevated in neural folds and hindgut of treated embryos, consistent with a proposed mechanism of neural tube defect prevention through stimulation of cellular proliferation.

{"id": "L0100275046", "content": "<p>Burst suppression is an electroencephalogram pattern that consists of a quasi-periodic alternation between isoelectric ‘suppressions’ lasting seconds or minutes, and high-voltage ‘bursts’. It is characteristic of a profoundly inactivated brain, occurring in conditions including hypothermia, deep general anaesthesia, infant encephalopathy and coma. It is also used in neurology as an electrophysiological endpoint in pharmacologically induced coma for brain protection after traumatic injury and during status epilepticus. Classically, burst suppression has been regarded as a ‘global’ state with synchronous activity throughout cortex. This assumption has influenced the clinical use of burst suppression as a way to broadly reduce neural activity. However, the extent of spatial homogeneity has not been fully explored due to the challenges in recording from multiple cortical sites simultaneously. The neurophysiological dynamics of large-scale cortical circuits during burst suppression are therefore not well understood. To address this question, we recorded intracranial electrocorticograms from patients who entered burst suppression while receiving propofol general anaesthesia. The electrodes were broadly distributed across cortex, enabling us to examine both the dynamics of burst suppression within local cortical regions and larger-scale network interactions. We found that in contrast to previous characterizations, bursts could be substantially asynchronous across the cortex. Furthermore, the state of burst suppression itself could occur in a limited cortical region while other areas exhibited ongoing continuous activity. In addition, we found a complex temporal structure within bursts, which recapitulated the spectral dynamics of the state preceding burst suppression, and evolved throughout the course of a single burst. Our observations imply that local cortical dynamics are not homogeneous, even during significant brain inactivation. Instead, cortical and, implicitly, subcortical circuits express seemingly different sensitivities to high doses of anaesthetics that suggest a hierarchy governing how the brain enters burst suppression, and emphasize the role of local dynamics in what has previously been regarded as a global state. These findings suggest a conceptual shift in how neurologists could assess the brain function of patients undergoing burst suppression. First, analysing spatial variation in burst suppression could provide insight into the circuit dysfunction underlying a given pathology, and could improve monitoring of medically-induced coma.

{"id": "L0100275053", "content": "<p>High frequency deep brain stimulation of the thalamus can help ameliorate severe essential tremor. Here we explore how the efficacy, efficiency and selectivity of thalamic deep brain stimulation might be improved in this condition. We started from the hypothesis that the effects of electrical stimulation on essential tremor may be phase dependent, and that, in particular, there are tremor phases at which stimuli preferentially lead to a reduction in the amplitude of tremor. The latter could be exploited to improve deep brain stimulation, particularly if tremor suppression could be reinforced by cumulative effects. Accordingly, we stimulated 10 patients with essential tremor and thalamic electrodes, while recording tremor amplitude and phase. Stimulation near the postural tremor frequency entrained tremor. Tremor amplitude was also modulated depending on the phase at which stimulation pulses were delivered in the tremor cycle. Stimuli in one half of the tremor cycle reduced median tremor amplitude by ∼10%, while those in the opposite half of the tremor cycle increased tremor amplitude by a similar amount. At optimal phase alignment tremor suppression reached 27%. Moreover, tremor amplitude showed a non-linear increase in the degree of suppression with successive stimuli; tremor suppression was increased threefold if a stimulus was preceded by four stimuli with a similar phase relationship with respect to the tremor, suggesting cumulative, possibly plastic, effects. The present results pave the way for a stimulation system that tracks tremor phase to control when deep brain stimulation pulses are delivered to treat essential tremor. This would allow treatment effects to be maximized by focussing stimulation on the optimal phase for suppression and by ensuring that this is repeated over many cycles so as to harness cumulative effects. Such a system might potentially achieve tremor control with far less power demand and greater specificity than current high frequency stimulation approaches, and may lower the risk for tolerance and rebound.</p>", "entities": [{"entity_type": "anatomy", "name": "thalamus"}, {"entity_type": "disease", "name": "essential tremor"}, {"entity_type": "symptom", "name": "tremor amplitude"}, {"entity_type": "symptom", "name": "tremor phase"}, {"entity_type": "biomarker", "name": "postural tremor frequency"}], "relationships": [{"entity_name1": "essential tremor", "relationship": "is_located_in", "entity_name2": "thalamus"}, {"entity_name1": "postural tremor frequency", "relationship": "is_biomarker_of", "entity_name2": "essential tremor"}]}

A systematic search of published original research yielded a total of 72 studies. After review of the risk of bias of the published studies, according to Cochrane Collaboration and the QUADUAS Group standards, 19 studies were selected. Overall 52 different miRs were reported. In particular, miR-133a/b (5 studies), miR-208a/b (6 studies), and miR-499 (7 studies) were well studied and found to be significant diagnostic and/or prognostic markers across different cardiovascular disease progression stages. miR-1 and miR-145b are potential biomarkers of ACS; miR-1 with higher sensitivity for all acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and miR-145 for STEMI and worse outcome of AMI. But when miRs were studied across different ACS study populations, patients had varying degrees of coronary stenosis, which was identified as an important confounder that limited the ability to quantitatively pool the study results. The identified miRs were found to regulate endothelial function and angiogenesis (miR-1, miR-133), vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation (miR-133, miR-145), communication between vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cell to stabilize plaques (miR-145), apoptosis (miR-1, miR-133, miR-499), cardiac myocyte differentiation (miR-1, miR-133, miR-145, miR-208, miR-499), and to repress cardiac hypertrophy (miR-133). Their role in these processes may be explained by regulation of shared RNA targets such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (or p21), ETS proto-oncogene 1, fascin actin-bundling protein 1, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel 4, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor LIM and SH3 protein 1, purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and transgelin 2. These mechanistic data further support the clinical relevance of the identified miRs. miR-1, miR-133a/b, miR-145, miR-208a/b, and miR-499(a) in plasma and/or serum show some potential for diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. However, biased selection of miRs in most studies and unexplained contrasting results are major limitations of current miR research. Inconsistencies need to be addressed in order to definitively identify clinically useful miRs.

This study aimed to investigate oral bacterial community diversity and dynamics in paediatric patients with malignancies in relation to the occurrence of oral mucositis. Patients with malignancies ( = 37) and reference individuals without known systemic disorders ( = 38) were recruited. For patients, oral bacterial samples were taken from mucosal surfaces both at the time of malignancy diagnosis and during chemotherapy. If oral mucositis occurred, samples were taken from the surface of the mucositis lesions. Oral mucosal bacterial samples were also taken from reference individuals. All samples were assessed using a 16S ribosomal RNA gene 454 pyrosequencing method. A lower microbial diversity (p<0.01) and a higher intersubject variability (p<0.001) were found in patients as compared with reference individuals. At the time of malignancy diagnosis (i.e. before chemotherapy) patients that later developed mucositis showed a higher microbial diversity (p<0.05) and a higher intersubject variability (p<0.001) compared with those without mucositis.

The clinical and microbiological criteria for VAP capture a population of patients with an array of conditions that range from serious to benign. Many of the benign events are manifestations of bacterial colonization superimposed upon pulmonary edema, atelectasis, or other non-infectious processes. VAP prevention measures that work by decreasing bacterial colonization preferentially lower the frequency of these mislabelled, more benign events. In addition, misclassification obscures detection of an impact of prevention measures on bona fide pneumonias. Together, these effects create the possibility of the paradox where a prevention measure may have a large impact on VAP rates but minimal impact on patients' outcomes.

{"id": "L0100397495", "content": "<p>Key questions remain unresolved regarding the advantages and limitations of colloids for fluid resuscitation despite extensive investigation. Elucidation of these questions has been slowed, in part, by uncertainty as to the optimal endpoints that should be monitored in assessing patient response to administered fluid. Colloids and crystalloids do not appear to differ notably in their effects on preload recruitable stroke volume or oxygen delivery. Limited evidence nevertheless suggests that colloids might promote greater oxygen consumption than crystalloids. It remains unclear, in any case, to what extent such physiological parameters might be related to clinically relevant outcomes such as morbidity and mortality. Recent randomized controlled trial results indicate that, at least in certain forms of fluid imbalance, albumin is effective in significantly reducing morbidity and mortality. Much further investigation is needed, however, to determine the effects of colloid administration on clinically relevant outcomes in a broad range of critically ill patients. The ability of administered colloids to increase colloid osmotic pressure (COP) constitutes one mechanism by which colloids might reduce interstitial oedema and promote favourable patient outcomes. However, the applicability of this mechanism may be limited, due to the operation of compensatory mechanisms such as increased lymphatic drainage. Attempts to increase COP might also be less useful in states of increased vascular permeability such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, although this issue has by no means been settled by empirical data. Colloids are clearly more efficient than crystalloids in attaining resuscitation endpoints as judged by the need for administration of far smaller fluid volumes. Among the colloids, albumin offers several advantages compared with artificial colloids, including less restrictive dose limitations, lower risk of impaired haemostasis, absence of tissue deposition leading to severe prolonged pruritus, reduced incidence of anaphylactoid reactions, and ease of monitoring to prevent fluid overload. The cost of albumin, nevertheless, limits its usage. Crystalloids currently serve as the first-line fluids in hypovolaemic patients. Colloids can be considered in patients with severe or acute shock or hypovolaemia resulting from sudden plasma loss. Colloids may be combined with crystalloids to obviate administration of large crystalloid volumes.

Rarely is there a continuation of care, which is aimed at screening for and treating this debilitating disease. Current treatment options for PTSD are held back by inconsistent efficacy, poor evidence, and a lack of understanding of its psychopathology. Without ‘gold standard’ assessment techniques to diagnose PTSD after an ICU admission, the development of care pathways is hindered. This paper advocates for two interwoven advances in psychiatric care (specifically for PTSD) after ICU: (1) incorporate the monitoring and treating of psychiatric co-morbidities during extended patient follow-up, and (2) rapidly adopting the latest research to maximize its benefit. The discovery that memories were not fixed, but malleable to change, set off a sequence of experiments that have revolutionized the approach to treating PTSD. It is hoped that the phenomenon of reconsolidation can be exploited therapeutically. In the act of remembering and re-storing traumatic memories, propranolol can act to dissociate the state of sympathetic arousal from their recollection. Often, ICU patients have multiple physical co-morbidities that may be exacerbated, or their treatment disrupted, by such a pervasive psychological condition. The rapid uptake of new techniques, aimed at reducing PTSD after ICU admission, is necessary to maximize the quality of care given to patients. Increasingly, the realization that the role of intensive care specialists may extend beyond the ICU is changing clinical practice.
